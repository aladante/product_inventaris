		{% situatie

			When the client for the inventory system came to me to create the application I had a choice which langauge to choose and which framework.

			I'm have more experience with for example with a normal old school deployment of applications.
			But to improve and assist my current employer more I decided to learn new skills that are actively used at VanMoof.
		}
		{% taak
			Look which software and skills are used at VanMoof and use this assignment to learn and apply those skills.
		}
		{% activiteiten
			At VanMoof we currently use a lot of kubernetes, terraform and other cloud related stuff.
			Also as a data engineer I have to create a lot of ETL's.

			There are a lot of integrations and I looked for the most used and decided to improve upon those skills.
		}
		{% resultaat
			I came to the understanding that the most essential skills that I'm currently lacking are kubernetes and terraform.

			I took and finished a cursuses about kubernetes, terraform and react and decided to use them in the application.

			The result was an application build with those previouse mentioned technologies.
			except for terraform, I will reflect on why in the next section.
		}
		{% reflectie
			I should have done better research on the usage of the technologies.
			Kubernetes and react fit well with the application context.

			But terraform didn't, after learning and finishing the cursus I came to a better understanding of terraform.
			It's not a tool to manage network infrastructures but a tool to manages cloud infrastructures.
			This means that it is able to create cloud instances such as databases or secrets for a big organization.
			It translates the code to actual products and creates them.
			For a single application there is no need to use terraform.

			I'm now however able to support VanMoof with terraform by using the knowledge learned for the cursus.
