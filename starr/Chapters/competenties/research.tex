		{% situatie
			To complete The application I have studied three cursuses.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Kubernetes
				\item Terraform
				\item React
			\end{itemize}

			I already have experience with spring boot but not the Graphql implementation.

			I need to study the documentation to implement Graphql in the backend.
		}
		{% taak
			Implement a graphql backend using spring boot.
		}
		{% activiteiten
			I first created a rest API. With this API I wanted to make sure the essential logic works.

			When the authentication part was finished, and I was able to create and login with user credentials I started working on the Graphql implementation.

			Graphql makes use of A completely different approach then A rest API does.
			I learned a lot with the React cursus where there is also a section on Graphql, but that was only the front-end implementation.

			So still needed to dive into the documentation to implement the back-end in Graphql.

		}
		{% resultaat
			The end result is a back-end and front-end that communicate with each other by the usage of Graphql.
		}
		{% reflectie
			A rest implementation is in my opinion more straight forward.
			The implementation is linked based on an endpoint.

			With a CRUD design the endpoint are easy to separate and the development is straight forward.

			Graphql uses schemes that are posted to the same end-point.
			I was quite unfamiliar with this new approach of designing a application.

			The whole concept took some time to fully digest.
			But I think this application was an excellent learning experience with lots to still improve upon.
